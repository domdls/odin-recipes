            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spend 5-8 hours engaging with your social media. Repeat daily until metastisization.</li>
                <li>Dice it up, baby!</li>
                <li>Combine cultural narcissism and ideological division in food processor. Pulse in short intervals until smoothly blended.</li>
                <li>Think about your inability for social mobility. Pretty messed up, huh?</li>
                <li>Realize you've been making this recipe for weeks now, instead of talking to friends or family.</li>
                <li>Heat caste-system iron pan over medium heat. Add social media and inability for social mobility.</li>
                <li>Once ingredients become fragrant in the pan (about 2 minutes), add blended mixture and raise heat to high.</li>
                <li>Eat the garlic raw. Nobody will talk to you now.</li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat and plate. Add green onions as desired.</li>
                <li>Throw it all out and make some instant ramen instead. Who cares.</li>
            </ol>
