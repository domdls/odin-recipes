            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2.5 cups desire for significance, finely chopped</li>
                <li>28oz canned social <a href="./alienation.html">alienation</a> (<em>Editor's Tip:</em> homemade can work as well, just make sure it's at least a few days old so the flavors have time to mingle)</li> 
                <li>1 heaping Tbsp inability to affect society</li>
                <li>6 fl oz desire for community</li>
                <li>3-4 large handfuls unresolved trauma</li>
                <li>1 large hatred for percieved "other"</li>
                <li>4 cups echo-chamber</li>
                <li>Gunpowder (to taste)</li>
                <li>1 bunch parsley (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine alienation, desire for significance, and inability to affect society in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Swallow your unresolved trauma.</li>
                <li>Before adding echo-chamber to the bowl, spend at least six sleepless nights reinforcing your opinions on social media (the more the better).</li>
                <li>Beat ingredients to combine.</li>
                <li>Pour mixture into large saucepan and add enough water to cover by about an inch. Add gunpowder and heat over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>When saucepan begins to boil over, reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Stir occasionally.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, knead your hatred for the percieved other while until stiff and barely malleable. This may take some time. Put your back into it!</li>
                <li>Once simmering gunpowder mixture is about to blow, remove from heat and slowly pour over your rock-hard hatred.</li>
                <li>This is a good point to add in your own personal flair to this recipe! Remember: the specifics don't matter. Left, right, center, up, down, whatever! All that matters is that you make it violent and angry.</li>
                <li>Vomit your unresolved trauma all over everything.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley.</li>
            </ol>
